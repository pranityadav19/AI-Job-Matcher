We offer financial infrastructure and a variety of services to serve the needs of a wide range of users, from startups to enterprises, with global scale and industry-leading reliability and product quality.&nbsp; All financial services businesses face a trade-off between access, which we want to expand, and risk, which we want to minimize. We use machine learning to scalably and intelligently optimize across both.</p>\n<p>Machine learning is an integral part of almost every service at Stripe. It is a key investment area with products and use cases that span merchant and transaction risk, payments optimization, identity, and merchant data analytics and insights. We are also using the latest generative AI technologies (such as LLMs and FMs) to re-imagine product experiences and developing AI Assistants and Agents both for our customers (e.g. Radar Assistant and Sigma Assistant), and also to make Stripes more productive across Support, Marketing, Sales, and Engineering roles within the company.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>About the team</strong></span></p>\n<p>We are dedicated to building and shipping the foundational AI and machine learning systems that will power our entire product suite.
